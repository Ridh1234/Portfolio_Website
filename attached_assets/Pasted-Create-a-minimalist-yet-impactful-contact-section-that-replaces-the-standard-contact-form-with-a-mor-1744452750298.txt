Create a minimalist yet impactful contact section that replaces the standard contact form with a more personal approach:
Layout & Design

Maintain the dark theme consistent with the rest of the portfolio
Create a visually striking section that serves as the final touchpoint of the website
Use subtle animations that lead the eye to the contact information

Content Structure

Begin with an inspiring programming quote that reflects a developer's mindset (choose something thoughtful about code, creativity, or problem-solving)
Follow with a simple yet inviting "Let's connect!" heading
Display my contact information clearly:

Email: sharmahridyansh3@gmail.com (with a copy-to-clipboard functionality)
Phone: +91 9024266007
Location: Bhilwara, Rajasthan



Visual Elements

Consider using code-inspired design elements (brackets, syntax highlighting, etc.) to frame the quote
Implement subtle particle or line animations that converge toward the contact details
Add subtle hover effects on the email address to indicate it's clickable

Navigation Integration

Add a "Hire Me" button in the top navigation bar that smoothly scrolls to this contact section
Ensure the navigation is fixed/sticky so the "Hire Me" option is always accessible

Technical Implementation (Frontend-Only)

Use only frontend technologies for all features (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
For email functionality, use mailto: links instead of form submissions
For copy-to-clipboard functionality, implement with JavaScript's Clipboard API
All animations should be handled with CSS or frontend animation libraries (GSAP, Framer Motion)
Remove ANY backend services or dependencies previously implemented
Replace any form submission logic with direct linking functionality
Ensure all interactivity works without any server-side processing

Important Notes

This is a FRONTEND ONLY project - do not implement any backend services
Do not include any server-side functionality for form handling
Use client-side alternatives for all features
Optimize all animations and effects for performance
Ensure cross-browser compatibility
Make sure all interactive elements are accessible

The final contact section should feel personal and inviting while maintaining the professional, tech-focused aesthetic of the overall portfolio.
